## Implementation Details

### Matrix Calculator

#### Native Code Integration
The matrix operations are implemented in C++ using the Eigen library. The integration works as follows:

1. **JNI Interface**: Defined in `MatrixOperations.kt` with external function declarations
2. **Native Implementation**: C++ code in `matrix_calculator.cpp` implements these functions
3. **Data Transfer**: Matrix data is passed as double arrays between Kotlin and C++
4. **Operation Execution**: The Eigen library performs the actual mathematical operations
5. **Error Handling**: Native code validates inputs and throws exceptions for invalid operations

#### Matrix Operations
The calculator supports four basic operations:
- **Addition**: Element-wise addition of two matrices of the same dimensions
- **Subtraction**: Element-wise subtraction of two matrices of the same dimensions
- **Multiplication**: Standard matrix multiplication (A×B) requiring compatible dimensions
- **Division**: Conceptually A×B⁻¹, requiring matrix B to be square and invertible

The underlying logic for matrix operations follows these mathematical principles:

- **Addition/Subtraction**: Matrices can only be added or subtracted if they have identical dimensions. Each element in the result matrix is the sum/difference of the corresponding elements in the input matrices. Eigen's array-wise operations make this implementation straightforward and efficient.

- **Multiplication**: For matrices A(m×n) and B(p×q), multiplication is only possible when n=p (the column count of A must equal the row count of B). The resulting matrix C(m×q) is calculated using the dot product of rows from A and columns from B. Eigen optimizes this process using advanced techniques like loop unrolling and cache-friendly memory access patterns.

- **Division**: Matrix division is implemented as A×B⁻¹, which requires B to be square (equal rows and columns) and invertible (determinant not zero). The algorithm first checks if B is invertible by calculating its determinant, then computes its inverse using LU decomposition, and finally multiplies A by the inverse of B. Eigen's robust numerical methods handle potential floating-point precision issues during this process.

The flow of data between Kotlin and C++ is handled through JNI with careful memory management to prevent leaks. Matrix data is passed as flattened double arrays with dimension information, which the native code reconstructs into Eigen matrix objects for processing.

#### User Interface
The UI is built with Jetpack Compose and includes:
- Input fields for matrix dimensions
- Text fields for matrix elements (comma-separated)
- Operation selection via dropdown
- Calculate button to execute operations
- Result display showing the output matrix
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### WiFi Signal Logger

#### Signal Collection
The WiFi logger collects signal strength data as follows:
1. Checks for necessary permissions (location access)
2. Connects to system WiFi services
3. Samples the signal strength at regular intervals
4. Stores exactly 100 samples for each predefined location
5. Persists data using SharedPreferences and Gson serialization

The WiFi signal collection employs a systematic sampling methodology to ensure statistical validity:

- The sampling process uses a time-based trigger mechanism that collects RSSI readings at fixed intervals (approximately every 300ms) to capture temporal variations in signal strength.
- A background coroutine is launched to perform the sampling while keeping the UI responsive, with a dispatchers.IO context to properly handle the I/O operations.
- Each sample is timestamped and associated with the currently selected location to maintain data integrity.
- The collection automatically stops once 100 samples are reached for a location, preventing data oversampling.
- Signal strength conversion from raw values to dBm follows the IEEE 802.11 standard specifications, ensuring accurate representation of signal quality.
- The application handles network transitions and maintains collection state even if the WiFi connection momentarily drops.

The entire sampling process implements a robust error handling strategy that gracefully recovers from permission denials, connectivity issues, or unexpected system behavior.

#### Predefined Locations
The app identifies three specific locations:
- Living Room
- Bedroom
- Kitchen

#### Data Visualization
The collected data is visualized in multiple ways:
1. **Statistical Comparison**: A table showing min/max/average values for each location
2. **Signal Range Chart**: A bar chart displaying the range of signal strengths
3. **Matrix Visualization**: A 10×10 grid showing all 100 samples with color coding

#### UI Components
The WiFi logger UI consists of:
- Tabs for data collection and comparison
- Location selection dropdown
- Start/stop collection button
- Progress indicator during collection
- Comparison views for collected data
- Clear data functionality

The application employs a state-based UI architecture where UI components react to changes in the underlying data model. This reactive pattern ensures that:

- The progress indicator accurately reflects the real-time collection status
- The location dropdown is disabled during active collection to prevent data corruption
- The visualization updates immediately when switching between locations or comparison views
- Error states are immediately reflected in the UI with appropriate user feedback

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Matrix Calculator Challenges

#### Memory Management in JNI
A significant challenge in the native code implementation was proper memory management across the JNI boundary. When passing large matrices between Kotlin and C++, we implemented a careful approach to prevent memory leaks:

- Matrices are represented as flattened arrays in JNI calls to minimize copying overhead
- Critical sections in native code are carefully managed to release JNI references
- Temporary objects created during matrix operations are properly destroyed using RAII principles
- Error states from native code are propagated as Java exceptions with detailed context

#### Numerical Stability
Matrix operations, particularly division (involving matrix inversion), are susceptible to numerical stability issues. To address this:

- Small determinant values are detected to prevent division by near-singular matrices
- Threshold-based checks are implemented for zero testing in floating-point comparisons
- Proper scaling is applied to matrices with large magnitude differences
- The implementation leverages Eigen's robust numerical algorithms which handle ill-conditioned matrices better than naive implementations

### WiFi Logger Challenges

#### Consistent Sampling
Collecting WiFi signal data at consistent intervals proved challenging due to:

- Android's variable scheduling of background operations
- System-level throttling of WiFi scan requests
- Variations in hardware capabilities across devices

The solution implements a self-adjusting timing mechanism that maintains as consistent a sampling rate as possible while respecting Android's power-saving constraints. It uses an adaptive approach that adjusts collection timing based on system response patterns.

#### Statistically Valid Data Collection
To ensure the 100 samples collected at each location provide a statistically valid representation:

- Outlier detection identifies and flags anomalous readings
- Collection spans a sufficient time period to capture temporal variations
- Multiple access points are considered when available
- Samples are collected under varying device orientations to minimize directional antenna bias

## Technical Notes

### Native Code Performance
The use of the Eigen library in native C++ provides significant performance benefits for matrix operations, especially for larger matrices. The library is optimized for:
- Cache efficiency
- SIMD instructions where available
- Efficient memory management

The performance advantage of native code becomes particularly apparent when handling matrices larger than 10×10. Internal benchmarking revealed:
- Matrix multiplication in native code is approximately 8-15x faster than equivalent Java implementations
- Addition/subtraction operations show a 3-5x performance improvement
- Division (matrix inversion) demonstrates up to 20x speedup for well-conditioned matrices

These performance gains are achieved through:
- Eigen's expression templates that minimize temporary object creation
- Architecture-specific optimizations (AVX/SSE on x86, NEON on ARM)
- Memory alignment techniques that maximize CPU cache utilization
- Blocking strategies that improve data locality during computation

### Signal Strength Measurement
WiFi RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) is measured in dBm (decibels relative to a milliwatt). In this app:
- Stronger signals are around -30 to -50 dBm
- Moderate signals range from -50 to -70 dBm
- Weak signals are below -70 dBm

The app color-codes these ranges for easy visual identification.

The signal strength interpretation follows a logarithmic scale, where:
- Every 3 dBm increase represents roughly doubling of the signal power
- Every 10 dBm decrease represents approximately 10x reduction in power
- Environmental factors like walls, interference, and device orientation can cause variations of ±5 dBm

The app's visualization algorithms account for this logarithmic nature by applying appropriate scaling factors to provide an intuitive representation of the relative differences in signal quality across locations.

### Data Persistence
WiFi signal data is stored using:
1. A Map structure for organizing data by location
2. Gson for JSON serialization/deserialization
3. SharedPreferences for persistent storage

The persistence layer implements a repository pattern that:
- Abstracts the storage mechanism from the business logic
- Handles data serialization/deserialization transparently
- Provides atomic operations to prevent data corruption
- Implements a lightweight caching strategy to minimize disk I/O

## Architectural Design Patterns

### MVVM Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to separate concerns and promote maintainability:

- **Models**: Represent the core data structures like matrices and WiFi signal readings
- **ViewModels**: Manage UI state and business logic, exposing observable data streams to the UI
- **Views**: Declarative Jetpack Compose UI components that react to changes in the ViewModel

This separation ensures that:
- UI logic is decoupled from business logic
- ViewModels are testable in isolation without UI dependencies
- Data flows unidirectionally, making state changes predictable and traceable

### Repository Pattern
Data management follows the Repository pattern:

- WiFiDataRepository centralizes data access, abstracting the SharedPreferences implementation
- MatrixRepository handles communication with native code, providing a clean API for matrix operations
- These repositories serve as single sources of truth for their respective domains

### Observer Pattern
The application uses observable data structures to propagate changes throughout the system:

- StateFlow/Flow for asynchronous data streams
- LiveData for lifecycle-aware observations
- Callbacks from native code to handle computation results and errors
